# InteractiveProjectiveWarper
CPU-based projective warping program. Allows the user to add mutliple images and manipulate their corners to compose custom images with unique perspectives. Similar to the Transform->Distort functionality in Photoshop. Uses OpenGL and GLUT to display images, while projective warping calculations are done on the CPU using the Eigen matrix library. Created as a Final Project for CPSC 4040 - Computer Graphics Images at Clemson University.
